## Team & My Role
During my exchange student period at Stony Brook University, I collaborated with two other students to develop **TerraTiles**. My primary responsibilities included:

- **Timothy**: Designed game levels, overall system architecture, and game flow, including the start, end page.
- **Tingting**: Designed and developed the UI.
- **Joh**: Developed game logic, handled tile interactions, and composed the background music.

## About the Game
TerraTiles is a 2D tile-based puzzle game where players must place the correct tiles to clear various missions. The game features interactive tiles representing elements such as:

- Earth
- Fire
- Water
- Rock
- Desert
- Space
- House
- Mud
- Poison

The goal is to strategically place tiles to trigger interactions between them and solve the puzzle.


  
## Presentation & Competition
We showcased **TerraTiles** at Stony Brook University's Annual Game Programming Competition. It was a rewarding experience to present our game and receive feedback from the community.
